October 28: Planning meeting
Present: Daniel, Trevor, Brandon, Rex
    - Rex will be out of town Thursday Oct 30 to Monday Nov 3, but he can
        still code while away.
    - Trevor will be out of commission starting Thursday Nov 6

    - We will be using Brandon and Rex's version of the CRC model
    - For data storage in files, we will be having each user in separate
        file, and each flight in a separate file. (see our data.txt)
        - slight change: instead of having stuff in separate lines, we
            will keep everything in one line separated by commas.
