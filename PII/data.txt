==File Formats==

    All directories mentioned below are relative to the root of our
    Java project

    === User info ===
    User info will be stored in text files in the directory named userinfo.
    Each user (both clients and admins) will have
    a file named after their email address. Since the '@' character is
	usually not allowed in filenames, we will replace it with an underscore
	in the filename Eg: "xiuqi.xia_mail.utoronto.ca.txt"
        Line 1: the password of the user
        Line 2: either "client" or "admin" depending on which type of user
            this is. 
    If user is an admin, there only be 2 lines
    Client personal and billing info starts on line 3
        All on one line:
        LastName,FirstNames,Email,Address,CreditCardNumber,ExpiryDate
    Itineraries a Client has booked starts on line 4
        Each line is an itinerary.
        An itinerary line consists of flight names separated by commas.
		A flight name is a concatenation of airline and flightnumber
		eg: AC2343, AC3402, US2039
        The flights are in order of departure time.
        The intinerary lines are also in order of departure time
        (of the first flight in the itinerary)

    === Flight info ===
    Flight records are stored in a text file named "flights.txt".
        Each line contains information for one flight:
        Number,DepartureDateTime,ArrivalDateTime,Airline,Origin,Destination,Price
		The Airline + Flight Number combination must be unique
		eg: you can have 2 flights named AC 123 and US 123
			but not 2 flights named AC 123 and AC 123

== Data Structure ==
    === Flights in FlightDatabase ===
    Flights will be stored in an ArrayList<Flight> in FlightDatabase
    
    === FlightDatabase in System ===
    The system stores an instance of FlightDatabase containing all the
    flight data

    === Flights in itineraries ===
    Flights are stored as ArrayList<Flight> in an itinerary.
    The elements of this ArrayList are just references to the flights
    in System, they are not copied over.

    === Itineraries in SearchResults ===
    Itineraries will be stored in SearchResults as a linked list
    to facilitate sorting.
    
    === Itineraries in Client ===
    Itineraries in Client will be stored in a linked list, sorted
    by departure time (of the first flight in the itineraries).
    Each newly booked itinerary will be inserted into the list
    in the correct place to maintain the sorted order.
    
    === Personal, billing info ===
    Stored as variables in the PersonInfo and BillingInfo classes.
    Each Client contains an instance of PersonalInfo and an instance
    of BillingInfo.

    === SearchResults ===
    A Client stores the most recent 5 SearchResults in an array[5]
    of SearchResults
    
    === Client in Admin ===
    When an Admin is editing Client info, it will store one or more instance
    of the Client/s it is currently editing in an ArrayList<client>.
    
    === User in System ===
    The System stores one instance of User (the logged in User)
