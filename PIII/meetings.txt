Meeting Nov 11, 2014 Trevor, Brandon, Rex
Stuff to improve/fix in PII
- Fully test Driver methods to make sure they work
- Add ability to save files
- Add ability to book flights for a client (also save to file)
- Change Itinerary and Flight to use Calendar
- Consistently use Itinerary instead of ArrayList<ArrayList<Flight>>
- Add login stuff (separate packaged from backend)
- Client and Admin

We don't know anything about Android yet
Will meet again tomorrow (Wednesday) at 5pm

----------------------------------------------

Wednesday Nov 13 Daniel, Brandon, Rex
TODO: make an Android project and copy our backend package into it
Made a plan for how our gui will work (see GUI_screens directory)
Will meet again tommorrow at some point in the afternoon

-------------------------------------------------

Thursday Nov 14 Daniel, Brandon, Rex

Brandon tested sortByTime in phase II, thought it wasn't working but
turns out it does work properly.

Daniel brought up issue: The Android version we are supposed to use
(Jellybean) is incompatible with Java 1.7
- Brandon and Daniel figured out we had not installed all android OS versions.
-Should be fine now. We plan to play around with it on friday.

Rex: Will start working on adding additional required features to
the Driver in our backend (Phase II). Driver will be the only point of
access for the frontend, so as long as Driver works consistently we're ok.

--------------------------------------------
Tuesday Nov 18, Brandon, Rex

Rex: backend stuff has been added to the android project. Point of access
for the backend is the BackendControlPanel class. 
Currently, we can add a new user and log in as that user.
No file-loading/saving for now

Brandon: try to hook up backend to android so that a user can register.

--------------------------------
Friday Nov 21: Rex, Brandon

As of the interview yesterday, our app starts on the login screen. We can 
switch to the registration screen to add new users, go back to the login
screen, and if the email/password is correct we can go to the main menu.

Issues: The hidden directories and auto-generated stuff (bin and gen) are
all in the repo, so we are having issues with our settings getting
commited and pushed to other people. Svn rm was tried but it has a side
effect of deleting files on other people's working copies when they update.
We will keep this files in the repo for now since it's hard to coordinate
backing up, svn rm'ing, and restoring the hidden files properly
over the internet. When we next meet we will do that stuff together.

Rex's goals for the next few days: 
- [done]convert the BackendControlPanel to follow the singleton design pattern
- [done]Androidify the file-reading features
- [done]Add file-writing features

----------------------------------
Progress report Tuesday Nov 25

Rex:
	A) Converted BackendControlPanel and the Databases (actually managers) to
	be singletons. If you need to access backend methods you have to do it like
	this:
		BackendControlPanel.getInstance(null).method()
	The null parameter in getInstance is supposed to be the application
	context. It's only needed for the first call to getInstance. The first call
	to getInstance occurs in MainActivity, and I've already added the code for 
	that, so you can just pass in null in the rest of the code.
	B) File read/write now works in Android. Right now, the backend
	automatically reads in the required data as csv files upon startup. It also
	saves all the data after a new user is registered. We probably need to make
	it so that it saves whenever the app suspends/exits.
	
	TODO:
	- Add methods for user to upload client info and flights
	- Figure out how to make sure the data is saved when the app suspends/exits
	- Rename all the "databases" to be managers instead
	- [done but not tested] Add the ability to book flights (make a bookings manager)
	- [done]Add methods in BackendControlPanel to expose search functionality to
		the frontend. (Trevor can you do this part?)
